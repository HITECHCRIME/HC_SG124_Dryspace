## Lyrics

```

dryspace
dryspace
dryspace 

CHORUS
that sys tech took too many nulls aye 
— I ain't givin' up — hackin' real till we cut 10 (into)
— I'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
(We) bring it home (fast) or we dry in space
Till we done 

Gettin' it done (on), tough nails through the coffin
Life runs its (own) course along the lines
of others telling you to stop (often)
Let'em try to touch you with their words
of dire that mean nothing to you lot
Decide for them or suffer the offers

They meant something
Now they mean nothing
They mean nothing

Dryspace, no friction to run 
Dryspace, no friction to run

CHORUS
that sys tech took too many nulls aye 
— I ain't givin' up — hackin' real till we cut 10 (into)
— I'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
(We) bring it home (fast) or we dry in space
Till we done 

```
