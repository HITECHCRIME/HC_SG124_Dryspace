## Lyrics

```
that sys tech took too many nulls aye (tries)
— I ain't givin' up — hackin' real till we cut 10 (into)
— I'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
(We) bring it home (fast) or we dry in space
Till we done

Life runs its own course along the lines
of others telling you to stop

Dryspace, no friction to run 
Dryspace, no friction to run

```
