<intro>
test

that sys tech (took) too many nulls aye 
i ain't givin' up - hackin' real till we cut
i'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
we bring home-ooor-we-dry in space till we done aye
(hard/and drop)
gettin' it done, tough nails 
through the coffin 
life runs its own course 
along the lines of others 
telling you to stop so often 

let'em try to touch you 
with their orders 
words of dire that mean nothing 
they mean nothing to you lot
they mean nothing

they meant something
now they mean nothing
they meant something
now they mean nothing
whispers whispers whispers whispers 
whispers me to run no
friction to run
no friction to run aye

ya aye
prrrrrrrrrrr

that sys tech took (too) many nulls aye 
i ain't givin' up - hackin' real till we cut (drop)
i'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
we bring home or we dry in space till we done aye
(hard/and drop)
gettin' it done, tough nails 
through the coffin 
life runs its own course 
along the lines of others 
telling you to stop so often 
let'em try to touch you 
with their orders 
words of dire that mean nothing 
they mean nothing to you lot
they mean nothing

they mean nothing 
they mean nothing

----------------------------------------------

OLD
burnin' haze kush with demigods
Decide for them or suffer the offers
They meant something
Now they mean nothing
dryspace 

CHORUS
that sys tech took too many nulls aye 
— I ain't givin' up — hackin' real till we cut 10 (into)
— I'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
(We) bring it home (fast) or we dry in space
Till we done 

Gettin' it done (on), tough nails through the coffin
Life runs its (own) course 
along the lines of others telling (you) to stop so often (whisper: so often)
Let'em try to touch you with their orders 
words of dire that mean nothing 
they mean nothing to you lot
Decide for them or suffer the offers

They meant something
Now they mean nothing
They meant something
Now they mean nothing
They mean nothing
Dryspace, no friction to run 
Dryspace, no friction to run
no friction to run
no friction to run
no friction to run
no friction to run

CHORUS
that sys tech took too many nulls aye 
— I ain't givin' up — hackin' real till we cut 10 (into)
— I'm burnin' haze kush with my circle ops
(We) bring it home (fast) or we dry in space
Till we done

## Notes

## Music Video

Each verse will be represented differently visually. Since we have a small amount of video length to work with it has got to be a quick story or just vibe experience. They meant something, now they mean nothing whispers - the thoughts and bad processes. Visualization of the circles in physical space - overlayed around my head. Environment, groupthink > emotions > thoughts > core self. Camera zooms inwards as we enter the radia of circles.

Alternatively we can also make a short film out of it. Hybrid of music video and atmospheric narrative intro. That would perhaps add another 50 seconds to the track or so. 2:30 is acceptable. Then the film will be either improvised or screen on stage to create an atmosphere of a story/narration/experience.

Video incoming. Sketched a micro storyboard.
